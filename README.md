# Project Title

Marketplace web application 

## Description

The project’s idea is to create a web application, working marketplace which will lead a
customer from picking of the products to the cart to checkout. By “checkout” we mean
that user will get e-mail confirmation about his order. Also, data like customer details or
products information/quantity etc. will be stored in database.
